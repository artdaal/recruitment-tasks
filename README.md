# recruitment-tasks
Test tasks from employers that I completed.

In this repo I collect test items completed as part of the employment process.

## List of recruitment tasks:
| Company name | Description |  Keywords  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- | :------ |
| [Lenta](https://github.com/artdaal/recruitment-tasks/blob/main/Lenta_test_task_18_08_22.ipynb) | The problem of predicting the churn of customers for a chain of stores of a large retailer. Identified an churned client. Modeling: feature engineering and LightGBM | machine learning, boosting, EDA, visualization, Scikit-Learn |
| [Sfera HR-tech](https://github.com/artdaal/recruitment-tasks/blob/main/Sfera_test_task_05_08_22.ipynb) | On a corpus of 1368 marked up texts, train a model for classifying vacancies into 3 groups: 1) there is definitely no remote work; 2) the vacancy is not about remote work; 3) remote work is possible. I have prepared standard solution: text embeddings were created using a pre-trained transformer (DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-sentence), then logistic regression was trained on class token (CLS) embeddings. | machine learning, NLP, LogReg, EDA, PyTorch, transformers, Scikit-Learn |
| [Evolwe.AI](https://github.com/artdaal/recruitment-tasks/blob/main/Evolwe.AI_test_task_24_06_22.ipynb) | It was necessary to create a neural network to classify bot user messages by intent. The problem of multiclass classification. I used a pre-trained BERT model, to which I added 2 linear layers. | machine learning, NLP, neural networks, EDA, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn |
